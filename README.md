EseView
=======

EseView is a graphical database browser for Windows, written in C# and using WPF.

EseView is designed to display databases made using the Microsoft Extensible Storage Engine (ESE), also known as JET.
(See [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg269259%28v=exchg.10%29.aspx) for more information about ESE.)

The ESENT Managed Interop library ([hosted on CodePlex](https://managedesent.codeplex.com/)) is used to access the ESE API from C#.
